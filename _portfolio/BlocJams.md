## Summary

Bloc Jams is a digital music player. It is simple and straightforward in its design, allowing users to select an album and play through its various songs. The application also provides additional functionality, such as the ability to switch back and forth between songs, play and pause a selected song, manipulate the position of the song and manipulate the volume of each song. Bloc Jams was the first major project I worked on during the Bloc program.

## Problem

Bloc Jams is a project that challenges beginning developers to utilize the core skillsets they learned in the programming fundamentals module of the Bloc program. The project calls for students to employ a mixture of HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, and later on to refactor the application with AngularJS.


## Solution

The first step that was taken was to set up the basic HTML structure and CSS of the application, and establish the viewport and various media queries. Students must also employ the requisite Javascript, writing functions that, among other things, dynamically generate the album template and song row content and establish play/pause functionality with event delegation, mouseover/mouseleave and click handlers. 

Students must also create and style the music player player bar, and utilize jQuery to handle different functions that allow listeners to skip from one song to another, while also updating the player bar with the new song information.

Functionality needs to be added to allow users to manipulate the seek bar and the volume bar. Students are also required to utilize the buzz music library.

Lastly, students must utilize jQuery to refractor certain functions with jQuery like ```window.onload``` and ```animatepoints```, and ```collection.js``` and ```album.js```.

## Results

The final product is an application with three pages. Students can check out an album, play and pause its different songs, switch between different songs, skip to different parts of an individual song using the seek bar and manipulate the volume of each song. 

## Conclusion

The major parts of the application worked as they were intended to work. I personally had doubts about my overall competance to put together the project's various aspects but was able to overcome difficulties with the assistance of my mentor. 

I found the complexity of certain processes to be somewhat surprising. For example, the process of playing/pausing different songs was startlingly multi-faceted, involving play and pause button templates, mouseover event listeners, mouseleave event and clickhandlers. 

I learned a number of things over the course of this project, primarily how HTML, CSS and Javascript work together, and how jQuery can be used to simplify vanilla Javascript. In the future, I am sure that I will be able to use these experiences to increase the interactivity of other similar applications.
