## Summary

Bloc Jams is a digital music player. It is simple and straightforward in its design, allowing users to select an album and play through its various songs. The application also provides additional functionality, such as the ability to switch back and forth between songs, play and pause a selected song, manipulate the position of the song and manipulate the volume of each song. Bloc Jams was the first major project I worked on during the Bloc program.

## Problem

Bloc Jams is a project that challenges beginning developers to utilize the core skillsets they learned in the programming fundamentals module of the Bloc program. The project calls for students to employ a mixture of HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, and later on to refactor the application with AngularJS.


## Solution

The first step students must take is to set up the basic HTML structure of the application, including a header and a subheader, in addition to the application's main selling points. After this, students move into styling the landing page, the navigation bar and the navigation bar logo. Other steps that need to be taken in this early section of the project include styling the selling points and establishing the viewport and various media queries. 

Some of the other major components that need to be created in the project's early stages are ```collection.html``` and ```collection.css```, and ```album.html```and ```album.css```.  CSS transitions have to be added to the application's selling points and then one moves into working with the application's requisite Javascript. Students must create a ```landing.js``` file, in addition to creating a myriad of different functions such as ```window.onload = function()``` and  ```var pointsArray = document.getElementsByClassName('point');```.
