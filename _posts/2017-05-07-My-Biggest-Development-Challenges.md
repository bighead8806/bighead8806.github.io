My biggest development challenge has already been outlined in other blog posts: it's retention. When working with new development concepts (particularly when assisted by my mentor), the material seems, for the most part, rather self-explanatory. 

Problems arise when I have to return to a concept that I learned and practiced a few weeks or months prior. The material often doesn't seem to stick, which suggests that as I move forward I will need to find strategies for continually practicing the skills I am currently learning while being enrolled in Bloc. 

Another problem I have identified is understanding the big picture. When looking at the work I did for Bloc Jams, for example, it is difficult for me to understand how one function influences the other and how the application as a whole works its way through the code based on user behavior. 

While I can usually interpret the behavior of each individual function, I will need to spend more time on comprehending the order of operations, perhaps more frequently utilizing the browser's development tools to help facilitate this learning process.
