My goals as a frontend developer are different from what I would assume are the goals of a majority of Bloc students. I am not 100% committed to switching my career to development following the completion of the Bloc program. 

That is not to say that I am not committed to learning as much as I can or that the skills I learn at Bloc will be incompatable in some way with my current vocation and long-term goals. 

I currently work in communications, a field that is reflective of my educational history and training. One aspect of my job is managing my employer's website. I am required to write and manipulate HTML and have some ability to read Javascript. I hope that through the completion of my work in the Bloc program my capacity to handle these two responsibilities will be strengthened.

I also hope to be able to retain some of the new information that I have learned thus far through the Bloc program. Although I hardly feel that I have mastered it, my understanding of languages like Javascript has grown exponentially since I started my work with Bloc. My goal is to find a professional position that allows me to continue using and reinforcing this knowledge-base. 

I suppose to be completely honest a final hope/goal that I have in regarding learning web development is that this skill set might open up additional employment options for me. I am by no means a fan of the traditional work schedule and all that it entails. I would love the ability some day to work independently as a freelancer and have more control over my time and schedule.
