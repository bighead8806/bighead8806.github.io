title: "My Experience With Bloc"

My experience with Bloc has been challenging, fascinating, fun, difficult, exhilarating, mind-numbing and very, very meaningful. I love learning and jumping headfirst into an entirely different (and incredibly complex) field of knowledge has been one of the most eye-opening experiences of my life. 

What I don't love, however, is the feeling like I am not very good at something, an experience that has been consistent throughout my Bloc experience thus far. This sensation has been off-set by a helpful mentor, but is still a constant in my life with Bloc. 

I have also struggled to keep up with the Bloc pace, and I would love if there was one pace even slower than the one I am currently on (which is already the slowest one). This is due primarily to my desire to revisit old material, an interest that is not really possible as the pace necessitates me plunging further ahead in each module.
